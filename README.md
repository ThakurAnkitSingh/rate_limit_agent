# üöÄ Rate Limiter Proxy Agent - Advanced API Protection System

## üéØ What Problem Does It Solve?

In today's digital landscape, APIs face critical challenges:
- Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
- Automated scraping and data harvesting
- Sudden traffic surges causing system overload
- Unauthorized API access and abuse
- Resource exhaustion from excessive requests

Our Rate Limiter Proxy Agent provides a comprehensive solution by implementing an intelligent protective layer between clients and your APIs, ensuring:
- Robust API security
- Consistent performance under load
- Fair resource allocation
- Granular access control

## üåü Key Differentiators

1. **Adaptive Rate Limiting Algorithms**
   - Token Bucket: Burst-friendly traffic shaping with configurable token regeneration
   - Sliding Window: High-precision request tracking with millisecond accuracy
   - Leaky Bucket: Guaranteed stable outflow with customizable leak rates
   - Fixed Window: Simple but effective time-sliced quotas

2. **Intelligent Request Management**
   - Priority-based request queueing
   - Graceful request throttling
   - Automatic retry mechanisms
   - Dynamic queue sizing
   - Request coalescing for efficiency

3. **Comprehensive Monitoring Suite**
   - Real-time traffic visualization
   - Predictive breach detection
   - Queue health metrics
   - Latency tracking
   - Rate limit violation alerts

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

- **Core Framework**: ExpressJS + TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Data Layer**: PostgreSQL via Supabase for scalable persistence
- **Rate Limiting Engine**: Redis for high-performance rate limiting
- **Security**: JWT-based authentication with rotating keys
- **API Design**: RESTful principles with OpenAPI specification
- **Development**: Modern Git workflow with automated testing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ThakurAnkitSingh/rate_limit_agent.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment:
   Create `.env` file with required variables:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
   REDIS_HOST=your_redis_host
   REDIS_PORT=your_redis_port
   REDIS_PASSWORD=your_redis_password
   REDIS_USERNAME=your_redis_username
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   ```

4. Start the service:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Project Architecture

The Rate Limit Agent is structured as a modular Node.js/TypeScript application:

### Core Components

1. Rate Limiting Engine (`src/utils/rateLimit.ts`)
   - Implements multiple rate limiting algorithms:
     - Token Bucket - Smooth rate limiting with burst handling
     - Rolling Window - Precise time-based limiting
     - Leaky Bucket - Constant rate processing
     - Fixed Window - Simple time-window based limiting
   - Queue management for handling excess requests
   - Redis-based state management

2. Request Handler (`src/helper/checkRateLimiter.ts`) 
   - Processes incoming API requests
   - Applies appropriate rate limiting strategy
   - Manages request queuing and processing
   - Handles rate limit responses

3. Configuration Management
   - Environment-based configuration via `.env`
   - Redis connection management
   - Rate limit policy configuration
   - API key management

### Data Flow

1. Request Processing:
   ```
   Client Request ‚Üí Load Config ‚Üí Check Rate Limit ‚Üí Queue/Process ‚Üí Response
   ```

2. Rate Limit Check:
   ```
   Get Limit Config ‚Üí Check Current Usage ‚Üí Apply Algorithm ‚Üí Update State
   ```

3. Queue Processing:
   ```
   Queue Request ‚Üí Monitor Limits ‚Üí Process Queue ‚Üí Send Response
   ```

### Technology Stack

- TypeScript/Node.js - Core runtime
- Redis - Rate limit state and queue management
- Express.js - API framework
- JWT - API key authentication
- Supabase - Configuration storage

The system is designed to be horizontally scalable with Redis providing distributed state management across multiple instances.
